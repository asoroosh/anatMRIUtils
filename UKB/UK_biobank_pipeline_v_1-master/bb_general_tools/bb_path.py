    supported extension, the default extension is appended and the new
    file name returned. If the prefix already has a supported extension,
    it is returned unchanged.

    If ``mustExist`` is ``True`` (the default), the function checks to see 
    if any files exist that have the given prefix, and a supported file 
    extension.  A :exc:`ValueError` is raised if:

       - No files exist with the given prefix and a supported extension.
    
       - ``replace`` is ``None``, and more than one file exists with the

    :arg allowedExts: List of allowed file extensions.
    
    :arg mustExist:   Whether the file must exist or not.
    
    :arg defaultExt:  Default file extension to use.

                      supported extensions (e.g. ``file.hdr`` and
                      ``file.img``), this dictionary can be used to resolve
                      ambiguities. It must have the structure::

                      suffixes exists, the ``suffix`` file will
                      be ignored, and replaced with the ``replacement`` file.
                      If multiple ``replacement`` files exist alongside the
                      ``suffix`` file, a ``PathError`` is raised.

    .. note:: The primary use-case of the ``replace`` parameter is to resolve
              ambiguity with respect to NIFTI and ANALYSE75 image pairs. By
              specifying ``replace={'.hdr' : ['.img'. '.img.gz'}``, the
              ``addExt`` function is able to figure out what you mean when you
              wish to add an extension to ``file``, and ``file.hdr`` and
              either ``file.img`` or ``file.img.gz`` (but not both) exist.
