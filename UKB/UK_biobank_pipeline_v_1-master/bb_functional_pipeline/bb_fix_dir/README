  =========
  
  SETUP
  
  =========

Requires: R (and maybe R-devel), with the following commands run (ideally as root) to install packages:
install.packages("kernlab", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("ROCR", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("class", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("party", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("e1071", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("randomForest", dependencies=TRUE)

Requires: FSL

Requires:
  MATLAB Runtime Component:
	If there is a folder 'compiled' in the FIX folder then the MATLAB portions have
	been compiled for running without MATLAB. The required MATLAB runtime is included
	in 'compiled/`OS`/`arch`'. To install this follow these instructions (starting 
	from this folder)
	Linux:
		cd compiled/Linux/x86_64
		    (...or compiled/Linux/i386 if you have a 32 bit OS and FIX has been compiled
		    for this platform)
		cp MCRInstaller.zip /tmp
		( cd /tmp; unzip MCRInstaller.zip && ./install )
			Follow the instructions from this point - note where you have installed this
			as you will need to change the FSL_FIX_MCRROOT variable in 'settings.sh' to
			refer to this location.
	OS X:
		cd compiled/Darwin/x86_64
		 	(...or compiled/Darwin/i386 on OS X 10.6)
		cp MCRInstaller.zip /tmp
		( cd /tmp; unzip MCRInstaller.zip && ./install )
			NB Mathworks only supports installation of one copy of the MATLAB Compiler 
			Runtime at a time on OS X - if you have already installed a different version
			and rely on it for other software you should not use the compiled version. 
or:

  MATLAB, with the following toolboxes:
		signal

or:
  Octave (>=3.4), with the following toolboxes:
        io
        (miscellaneous 1.0.11 for 3.4)
        statistics (1.1.3 for 3.4)
        specfun
        general
        control (2.2.5 for 3.4)
        (struct for 3.4)
        (optim for 3.4)
        signal
  
  To install these toolboxes, use the script setup_octave.sh - this will ask for a 'sudo' password if
  required (use -g option to install globally rather than for just this user account).
  	   
  Octave 3.4
  ========== 
  EPEL on Centos/RedHat/Scientific Linux provides Octave 3.4 which cannot install several
  packages from Octave forge, so download the following from http://sourceforge.net/projects/octave/files/Octave%20Forge%20Packages/Individual%20Package%20Releases/
  	miscellaneous-1.0.11.tar.gz
  	statistics-1.1.3.tar.gz
  	control-2.2.5.tar.gz
  	signal-1.1.2.tar.gz
  Change to the folder where these have been downloaded to and install with:
  	octave --eval 'pkg install -auto -forge io; pkg install -auto miscellaneous-1.0.11.tar.gz; \
pkg install -auto statistics-1.1.3.tar.gz; pkg install -auto -forge specfun; pkg install -auto -forge general; \
pkg install -auto control-2.2.5.tar.gz; pkg install -auto -forge struct; pkg instal -auto -forge optim; \
pkg install -auto signal-1.1.2.tar.gz;'
  To install system-wide run Octave as an admin user and add the option '-global' to each 'pkg install' command.

  Octave 3.6
  ==========
  Install the required packages using:
    octave --eval 'pkg install -auto -forge io; pkg install -auto -forge statistics; \
pkg install -auto -forge specfun; pkg install -auto -forge general; \
pkg install -auto -forge control; pkg install -auto -forge signal;'
  To install system-wide run Octave as an admin user and add the option '-global' to each 'pkg install' command.
    
  =============
    
  Configuration
  
  =============

Setup: edit the "settings.sh" script to reflect your system setup - descriptions
of the options are given in this file.
If using the compiled MATLAB version, make sure that FSL_FIX_MCRROOT is set to the location of the MATLAB
Compiler Runtime you installed as per the instructions above.
Setup for using inside HCP pipelines (only needed for HCP):
Ensure the FSL_FIX_CIFTIRW and FSL_FIX_WBC variables in settings.sh are pointed
at your HCP Workbench MATLAB CIFTIRW and Workbench folders respectively.


  ==================
  
  MATLAB Compilation
  
  ==================
  
  The MATLAB .m files can be compiled to allow fix to run without requiring MATLAB
  licenses (especially useful where it will be run on a cluster).
  To compile, ensure you have the MATLAB compiler toolbox installed and GNU make
  (Centos/RedHat/Scientific Linux: sudo yum -y install make
   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install make
   OS X: Install XCode and the command line tools (XCode Preferences > Downloads) )
  then issue the following command from within the fix folder:
     ./build_MATLAB
  
  This will install the binaries into 'compiled/`OS`/`arch`' (eg 
  compiled/Darwin/x86_64 or compiled/Linux/x86_64) and create a file 'MCR.version'
  containing the version number of the MATLAB Compiler Runtime necessary to run 
  this programs. Install this into a suitable location following these instructions
